# Project Submission
- proposal.pdf: if you have completed the pre-requisite Capstone Proposal project. Please also include your review link in the student submission notes
- project_report.pdf: addressing the five major project development stages. The recommended page length for a project report is approximately nine to fifteen pages
- report.html: An HTML export of the project notebook with the name report.html
- dog_app.ipynb: file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered.
- README: briefly describes the software and libraries used in your project, including any necessary references to supporting material. 
- additional supporting material such as datasets, images, or input files that are necessary for your project's development and implementation. If these files are too large and you are uploading your submission, instead provide appropriate means of acquiring the necessary files in your included README
- Any additional images used for the project that were not supplied to you for the project. Please do not include the project data sets in the dogImages/ or lfw/ folders.
